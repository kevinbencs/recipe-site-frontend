## Description of the Page



The style of the website was built by the Sass files. These files are in the `/src/style directory`. The different pages are in the `pages` directory. Contents that are on all pages are in the `components` directory. You will find the `header`, the `footer`, the `cookie section`, the `scroll-to-top component`, and the `comments` related to the recipe.tsx here. The components directory also includes the `slider menu` and the `hamburger menu`.
